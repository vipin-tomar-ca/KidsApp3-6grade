    question: 'A farmer has 24 chickens and ducks. If there are 8 more chickens than ducks, how many chickens does the farmer have?',
    type: 'numerical',
    correctAnswer: 16,
    explanation: 'Let d = ducks, then chickens = d + 8. So d + (d + 8) = 24, which gives 2d = 16, so d = 8 ducks and 16 chickens.',
