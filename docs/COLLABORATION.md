# Collaboration Guide - Team Development in Replit

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Setup and Multiplayer Configuration

### Team Structure
Our development team consists of:
- **3 Developers**: Frontend, Backend, and Full-stack specialists
- **1 Content Curator**: Educational content review and academic standards alignment

### Setting Up Replit Multiplayer

#### Step 1: Enable Multiplayer Mode
1. **In your main Replit project**:
   - Click the "Share" button in the top-right corner
   - Select "Invite to edit" 
   - Choose "Anyone with the link can edit" or invite specific team members by email
   - Copy the collaboration link to share with your team

2. **For team members joining**:
   - Click the shared collaboration link
   - Sign in to their Replit account
   - The project will open in multiplayer mode with real-time editing

#### Step 2: Configure Team Permissions
```bash
# In Replit console, set up team member roles
# Main project owner manages these settings:

Team Member Permissions:
â”œâ”€â”€ Lead Developer (You)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Full repository access
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Deployment permissions  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Environment variable management
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Database administration
â”œâ”€â”€ Frontend Developer
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ client/ directory focus
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Component development and styling
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Accessibility implementation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ UI/UX optimization
â”œâ”€â”€ Backend Developer  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ server/ directory focus

- **Instant sync**: Changes are saved and synced automatically
- **Chat integration**: Built-in chat for quick communication
- **Voice/video calls**: Optional integration for meetings

### Development Workflow

#### Branch Strategy in Replit
Since Replit works differently from traditional Git workflows, we use a fork-based approach:

```bash
Main Development Flow:
â”œâ”€â”€ Main Project (Production)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Always deployable
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Contains latest stable code
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Accessible to all team members
â”œâ”€â”€ Feature Development
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Each developer forks for major features
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Test changes independently
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Merge back through code review
â””â”€â”€ Content Updates
    â”œâ”€â”€ Content curator has direct edit access
    â”œâ”€â”€ Educational content updates in real-time
    â””â”€â”€ Developer review for technical integration
```

#### Daily Workflow
1. **Morning Standup** (15 minutes)
   - Review previous day's progress
   - Identify current day's goals
   - Discuss any blockers or dependencies

2. **Development Sessions** (using Replit multiplayer)
   - Developers work in assigned directories
   - Real-time collaboration on shared components
   - Continuous integration testing

3. **End-of-day Review** (30 minutes)  
   - Demo new features to the team
   - Content curator reviews educational materials
   - Plan next day's priorities

## ðŸ’» Code Style Standards

### TypeScript/React Guidelines
```typescript
// File naming convention
ComponentName.tsx       // React components (PascalCase)
utilityFunction.ts     // Utilities and services (camelCase)  
CONSTANTS.ts           // Constants (UPPERCASE)
component-name.test.tsx // Test files (kebab-case with .test)

// Component structure standard
interface ComponentProps {
  // Props documentation
  userId: string;              // Required props first
  onAction?: () => void;      // Optional props second
  className?: string;         // className always optional and last
}

/**
 * Component description
 * @param userId - Unique identifier for the user
 * @param onAction - Callback when action is performed
 * @param className - Additional CSS classes
 */
const ComponentName: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({
  userId,
  onAction,
  className = ""
}) => {
  // State declarations first
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
  
  // Custom hooks second
  const { data, loading } = useCustomHook();
  
  // Event handlers third
  const handleEvent = useCallback(() => {
    // Implementation
  }, [dependencies]);
  
  // Effects last
  useEffect(() => {
    // Effect implementation
  }, [dependencies]);
  
  // Early returns for loading/error states
  if (loading) return <LoadingComponent />;
  if (error) return <ErrorComponent />;
  
  // Main render
  return (
    <div className={`component-container ${className}`}>
      {/* JSX content */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ComponentName;

## ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy

### Collaborative Testing

#### 1. Continuous Testing During Development
```typescript
// Real-time testing as team develops
// Frontend developer writes component:
const NewComponent = () => {
  // Component implementation
};

// Backend developer immediately tests integration:
const testComponentIntegration = async () => {
  // API integration testing
};

// Content curator verifies educational content:
const verifyEducationalValue = (content) => {
  // Educational standards checking
};
```

#### 2. Team Testing Sessions
```bash
# Weekly team testing protocol:
1. All team members join Replit multiplayer session
2. Test new features together on different devices
3. Content curator tests with child perspective
4. Developers test edge cases and error handling
5. Document issues and assign fixes
```

#### 3. Cross-functional Review
```typescript
// Example: Math lesson testing checklist
interface TestingChecklist {
  technical: {
    functionalityWorks: boolean;
    accessibilityCompliant: boolean; 
    performanceAcceptable: boolean;
    mobileResponsive: boolean;
  };
  educational: {
    gradeAppropriate: boolean;
    learningObjectiveClear: boolean;
    engagementLevel: number; // 1-10
    difficultyProgression: boolean;
  };
  safety: {
    contentAppropriate: boolean;
    privacyCompliant: boolean;
    dataSecuritySound: boolean;
    parentalControlsWorking: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Quality Assurance

#### Automated Testing
```bash
# Set up automated testing in Replit
# Add to package.json scripts:
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
    "test:accessibility": "jest --testPathPattern=accessibility",
    "test:safety": "jest --testPathPattern=safety"
  }
}

# Run tests regularly during development
npm run test:watch  # Continuous testing during development
npm run test:coverage  # Weekly coverage review
```

#### Manual Testing Protocols
1. **Child Usability Testing**: Test with actual children (with parental permission)
2. **Accessibility Testing**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation verification
3. **Cross-device Testing**: Tablets, phones, desktop computers
4. **Performance Testing**: Load times and memory usage monitoring
