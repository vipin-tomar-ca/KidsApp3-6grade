## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Real-Time Collaboration Features

#### Live Editing
```bash
# Multiple developers can simultaneously edit:
Frontend Developer:    client/src/components/MathModule.tsx
Backend Developer:     server/routes/progress.ts  
Full-Stack Developer:  client/src/services/aiHints.ts
Content Curator:       docs/PARENTAL_GUIDE.md

# Replit automatically:
- Shows live cursors and user presence
- Syncs changes in real-time
- Prevents editing conflicts
- Maintains complete edit history
```

#### Communication Tools
- **Integrated Chat**: Quick questions and status updates
- **Voice/Video Calls**: Complex problem solving and planning
- **Code Comments**: Context and decision documentation
- **Live Cursors**: See where teammates are working

### Daily Development Cycle

#### Morning Standup (15 minutes)
```markdown
## Daily Standup Agenda
1. What did you complete yesterday?
2. What will you work on today?  
3. Any blockers or dependencies?
4. Code review requests?
5. Educational content updates needed?

## Example Updates:
Frontend Developer: "Completed math problem UI, need backend API for progress tracking"
Backend Developer: "Progress API ready for testing, working on achievement system today"
Content Curator: "Reviewed 15 math lessons, flagged 2 for age-appropriateness concerns"
```

#### Development Session (Continuous)
- Work in assigned directories with live collaboration
- Use integrated chat for quick questions
- Tag teammates in code comments for review
- Test features together using multiplayer debugging

#### End-of-Day Review (30 minutes)
- Demo new features to the team
- Content curator reviews educational materials
- Plan next day's priorities and dependencies
- Update documentation and progress tracking

## 📁 File Organization for Team Development

### Directory Ownership
```bash
project-root/
├── client/src/
│   ├── components/          # Frontend Developer lead
│   ├── pages/              # Frontend Developer lead  
│   ├── services/           # Full-Stack Developer lead
│   ├── hooks/              # Shared (all developers)
│   └── __tests__/          # Full-Stack Developer lead
├── server/                 # Backend Developer lead
├── shared/                 # Backend Developer lead
├── docs/                   # Content Curator lead
├── README.md              # Content Curator + Lead Developer
└── package.json           # Lead Developer only
```

### Collaboration Guidelines

#### File Editing Etiquette
```markdown
## Before Editing Shared Files:
1. Check who else is currently editing (live cursors)
2. Communicate your changes in team chat
3. Make focused, single-purpose edits
4. Test changes immediately after editing
5. Document complex changes with comments

## When Conflicts Arise:
1. Communicate immediately in chat
2. Use "View History" to see recent changes
3. Coordinate resolution in voice/video call
4. Test thoroughly after conflict resolution
```

#### Code Review Process
```typescript
// Real-time code review in Replit:
// 1. Developer makes changes
// 2. Tags reviewers in code comments:

/**
 * @review @frontend-dev @content-curator
 * New math problem component with accessibility features
 * - Added keyboard navigation support
 * - Implemented text-to-speech integration
 * - Included grade-appropriate language validation
 */
const MathProblemComponent = () => {
  // Implementation
};

// 3. Reviewers provide feedback in comments
// 4. Changes made collaboratively in multiplayer
// 5. Testing performed together
```

## 🔧 Development Environment Setup

### Replit Configuration
The `.replit` file is configured for team development:

```toml
[collaboration]
multiplayer = true
max_editors = 4
show_cursors = true
chat_enabled = true
voice_chat = true

[permissions]
owner = ["deploy", "secrets", "database", "settings"]
developer = ["edit", "debug", "test", "console"] 
curator = ["edit:docs", "edit:content", "review"]
```

### Environment Variables Management
```bash
# Only Lead Developer manages secrets:
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=xxxxx
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=xxxxx
# etc.

# Team members use development environment:
- Firebase disabled (works offline)
- Test data for development
- Full functionality available locally
```

### Testing Collaboration
```bash
# Collaborative testing workflow:
1. Frontend Developer: Creates new component
2. Backend Developer: Tests API integration immediately
3. Full-Stack Developer: Tests end-to-end functionality  
4. Content Curator: Validates educational content
5. All team members: Test accessibility and safety features

# Use Replit's collaborative debugging:
- Set breakpoints together
- Share console outputs
- Test different user scenarios simultaneously
```
